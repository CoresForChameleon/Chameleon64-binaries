Rampage - ported to Chameleon 64 from Gehstock's/Slingshot's MiST port.

You will need a file called Rampage.rom on an SD card.

For copyright reasons I don't distribute the ROM file, so you
will need to generate it from a MAME ROM set.

This can be done by concatenating the ROM files manually,
but the easiest way to do it is to use sebdel's new
mra-tools utility with the enclosed Rampage.mra file.
mra-tools which can be found here:  https://github.com/sebdel/mra-tools-c
(Source + binaries for both Windows and Linux.)

Insert coins by pressing '5' on the PS/2 keyboard, the C64 keyboard
or the "play" button on a CDTV controller.

F12 on the PS/2 keyboard, '<-' on the C64 keyboard or "power" on the
CDTV controller will bring up a minimal OSD from which you can set
the difficulty/free play DIP switch settings, and also enable the
"Cheat" DIP - though I haven't yet figured out how to activate the cheat!

The CDTV pad can control George or Lizzie, depending on the port switch, or
from the C64's own joystick ports if you have a two-button controller.

All three characters can be controlled from a PS/2 keyboard, or with the
Docking Station, again if you have a two-button controller.

George's keys:
WSAD, left ctrl, alt, shift, caps lock

Lizzie's keys:
IKJL, B, N

Ralph's keys:
Cursor keys, right ctrl, alt, shift, enter
